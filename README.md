# My Magic the Gathering Trade Binder
Hello there!
This is the second project I will be presenting at Flatiron! I am super excited to go through this journey to learn and master the coding language that is React. For this project, I decided to tackle another hobby of mine: collecting cards from the TCG (trading card game) that I like to call Muhicccc! The Miglee-oon, or MTG for short. I wanted to create a way to catalog my ever-growing collection to trade with people.

My love for the game started at the end of my high school career. I have always tried to get into a TCG that challenged me in deck-building creativity. Pokemon, Yugioh, Zach Bell, Digimon, and even the DragonBall Z TCGs were some of the card games I got into before finding my true love. I knew of Magic's existence from my days collecting Pokemon cards, but I did not know anyone who actually played the game.

The card image above was the first rare I ever pulled in Magic the Gathering, way back around 2006... Four years before, I learned actually to play the game. The art from this card and several others command the respect of many collectors. 

It was not until 2010 that I met people that showed me how to play this fantastic game for the first time. With the summer coming up and enough free time, my friend Noos and I would hit our LGS at the time, Collect-A-Card & Comics. This was the prime time for MTG as the Zendikar block was going strong, and the "new at the time" Mirrodin block was about to drop.

This guy here... was the big boogie man at that time in Standard, a trendy format then. Commander at the time of writing is the most prevalent format to date. I have had such good memories with this game, from playing with my then-girlfriend, now my wife. To meeting new people that challenged my creativity even further in deck building. I wanted to add flavor to the game by making proxy cards with new art. 

I love this game dearly... I have even given my firstborn son the name Gideon to honor the late great white Hieromancer Gideon Jura. A noble and powerful Planeswalker with a firm conviction for truth and justice. Unfortunately, he met his demise in the War of the Spark set when he sacrificed himself to defend his friend Liliana, which ultimately helped seal the great evil at the time Nicol Bolas. However, as seen in the card below... his death meant victory for the Gatewatch and the Multiverse. (I am tearing up as I write this... this character has had a significant impact on my life.)

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
